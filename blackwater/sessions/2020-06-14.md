# Session 19: She's Gone For Good, Right?

## The Party

Everyone was present, with no substitutions!

## Summary

* Lamikel jumps at Dunwich.  She blinks.
* Guy kills off the last minion with a glaive to the back.

> My revenge will be long and sweet.

* Lady Dunwich reaches for the rod behind her.
* Yenna runs toward the only dry land she can see, which is a nearby coffin.
* Edgar examines the staff.
* Arc TK grabs for the rod.
* Edgar shouts the word "Hephaestas" while pointing the rod, but nothing happens.
* Lamikel charges, but she commands "Stop, go back!", which he obeys.

> I will find you and make you suffer.

* She vanishes.
* Yenna continues to move forward, as does Edgar
* Brorvec starts singing.
* Lamikel passes out, reverting to Sorven, who is very, very busted up.
* Yenna jumps onto the coffin, runs, but slips and face-plants.
* Guy makes it to Sorven, and begins doing first aid.
* Yenna comes out of her rage and joins Guy doing first aid on Sorven.
* Edgar turns on his light.
* Arc does TK lockpicking to get out of the cage, then goes over to help Edgar.
* Edgar picked the lock on Brorvec's cage.
* Arc ties a knot in the rop attaching it to the grate.  It slips the first time, so they try again.
* Brorvec climbs out, assisted by Edgar.
* Arc finds that he can't untie the knot.  We lose a few feet of rope.
* Arc, Brorvec, and Edgar loot the room.  Arc and Brorvec snipe at each other.
* Arc and Brorvec go looking for Del.  Arc levitates around, ties off the rope.  Brorvec splashes around trying to get out, before succeeding.
* Arc applies First Aid to Del.  Del hands over keys.
* Brorvec goes and grabs the backpacks from the central chamber.
* Arc bubbles the rations and takes them back over to the other room.
* Edgar and Guy look around. The skeleton on the wall may be even larger than a Strig.  Edgar takes a lot of notes.
* Arc and Edgar argue about burning things versus selling them.
* Guy, Yenna, and Brorvec attempt first aid and fail.
* Arc gets Sorven moved back to the well room, then the piles of stuff.
* Del identifies the emerald powerstone, says the other objects are magical: spyglass, large book, silver dagger, bracers
* Arc and Del work to heal Sorven
