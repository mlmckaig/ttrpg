# Roger G. Norton

[CoC Character Sheet PDF](https://ricko.is/coc-roger)

Roger is a 27-year-old mechanical and chemical engineer, and an only child.
He was born in Newark, New Jersey, where he lived with his parents for most of his life.

His parents were both active in politics, especially leading into the Great War, and continued to bring it into the home during Roger's childhood.
His father was one of the leading proponents of Senator Phipps' 1921 Federal Highway Act, which he said would change America even more than the railroads had forty years before.
Roger, already showing a mechanical aptitude, grew a deep interest in the emerging automotive field.
While he never had the coordination or looks to become a flashy race car driver, he always had ideas on how to coax more performance out of any engine.

Roger attended the [Newark Technical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Institute_of_Technology) for two years before dropping out.
He felt the curriculum was too classroom-oriented without enough hands-on experience.
While he very much enjoyed the chemistry coursework, he had limited ability to apply it in practice, only frustrating him further.
He'd already been working odd repair-work and tuning jobs to supplement his income — even though his parents would have happily provided just about anything he could have wished for — and transitioned to this full time.

Dropping out and going into a field his father saw as manual labor only strained their relationship.
It would come to a head every time Roger would show up to a family dinner with grease under his nails.

## Backstory

**Personal Description**: Roger is 6'1" with brown hair that he keeps in a tight buzz cut.  He's of average build and looks, with the fair skin of someone who spends his days in a garage. He seems to always have dirt and grease under his fingernails, even when freshly washed.

**Ideology/Beliefs**: Roger believes only in what he can see in front of him.  He thinks organized religion is a con game.  He's open to new ideas, but convincing him takes a solid, methodical effort.

**Significant People**: Roger's relationship with his parents has been strained since he dropped out of college 7 years ago.  His father is a lawyer and believes the only path to earning success starts with education.  His mother is more of a make-your-own-way type, but is caught between the two strong wills.

**Meaningful Locations**: Roger is most at home in a workshop or even just a well-stocked garage.  His own is both: a small 12x12 garage that is covered in mismatched and scrounged tools and equipment, with barely enough room to move, much less work.

**Treasured Possessions**: Roger has a cheap Swiss Army knife that was his first serious "engineer's tool" he bought for himself when he was still a kid.  It's worn, the tools stick, and the blade is quite dull.

**Traits**: Roger occasionally gets lost in thought when looking at complex systems, trying to pick apart things he could tinker with, forgetting to talk and losing track of time.

**Injuries & Scars**: Roger's hands have taken a beating from years of working on machine parts, along with a few odd patches of colors from minor chemical burns and exposures.

**Phobias & Manias**: Roger will spend too long trying to fix broken things, and has trouble with the decision to give up and throw something away.

## Gear & Possessions

When he's got time to repair, he's got a beaten leather shoulder bag where he'll throw a few tools.  In general, this would mean screwdrivers with a few heads, a rubber mallet or hammer, pliers, adjustable crescent wrench,  wire cutters, and maybe a few half-working pieces from previous efforts.  (Light switches, wooden dowels, loose screws, odd bits of copper wiring, etc.)

At the beginning of the story, since we're on a drive, he'd have tools appropriate for servicing the truck, as well as a flashlight, a crowbar, and a jack.  He'd also have a few quarts of oil and some odd lengths of rubber hose thrown in the back of the truck.

## Cash & Assets

**Spending Level**: $50

**Cash**: $250

**Assets**: Roger has established his own engineering and repair shop.  He rents out a small 12x12 space in Hoboken that would be considered his office or headquarters, if he ever had the business sense to incorporate.  The machine shop is well stocked, but many of the tools are borrowed or of his own making.  The space is barely large enough to fit a small car, certainly not a truck, and is full of half-finished projects.
